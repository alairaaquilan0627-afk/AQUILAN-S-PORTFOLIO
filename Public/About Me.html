    <p>My name is Alaira Aguilar Aquilan, I am 18 years old. My birthday is <a href="./Public/Birthday Cake.html">June 27,2007</a>   I live in Purok Aloevera, Kitabog, Titay, Zamboanga Sibugay. I have mother and father, my mother dear is Reggie Aguilar Aquilan and my father earth is Norustre Abualas Aquilan. I have 4 siblings, 1 sister and 3 brothers, I'm the second older daughter. My Grandfather died when I was 9 years old, and I was so sorrowful because he is my favorite Grandfather and he trully love me. I missed him so much.  
        <p> I graduated elementary at Kitabog Elementary School. I graduated high school at Ipil Montessori Academy. Now, I currently studying at Western Mindanao State University with Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My dreams are so many that I can't type that much so I'm just gonna tell you some of my dreams, some of my dreams is I want to travel around the world and use my skills to earn money. I motivate myself to study more to reach my dreams for my family and most important is my mother dear and father earth, so that I could reciprocate them for what they did to me and my siblings.</p>
        <p> My hobbies are playing mobile games and sleeping. I'm proud for being virgin. My habits are biting my nails out of nowhere and pilling the skin of my lips. Sometimes when I get bored of my phone, I started cleaning the kitchen (only kitchen). My favorite food are spaghetti and mom's adobong bangus. I like eating with my family, bond together and always going out with family everywhere and anywhere. </p> <br/>
